## 🧠 Core Philosophy

MtFujiTravel is **not a booking site**.  
It is a **landmark-first travel knowledge graph** expressed as static pages.

LLMs are used to:
- generate itinerary variants (time, season, budget)
- translate and localize instructions
- cluster recommendations by intent (hike, relax, onsen, photos)
- produce decision trees for travel planning

Humans are required to:
- verify safety guidance (weather, routes)
- validate access and transit logic
- keep listings current
- prevent misinformation

---

## 🗂️ Content Architecture (LLM-Native)

MtFujiTravel is built around **Fuji-centered entities**.

### Core Entities
- Landmark Node (Mt Fuji)
- Viewpoint / Photo Spot
- Town / Area
- Hotel / Ryokan / Onsen
- Restaurant / Café
- Activity (Hike, Onsen, Lake, Shrine)
- Itinerary
- Evidence
- Collection

Each entity:
- has a stable schema
- has a canonical URL
- cross-links by distance, season, and intent
- is programmatically generatable
